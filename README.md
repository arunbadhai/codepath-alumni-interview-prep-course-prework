## CodePath Alumni Interview Prep Class Prework
As I said in [my InterviewBit profile gif](https://github.com/tachyonlabs/codepath-alumni-interview-prep-course-prework/blob/master/interviewbit-profile.gif), I've actually been using InterviewBit for about three months now (though I still have a ways to go before reaching Code Ninja status). My profile is https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/Tachyon

### Checkpoint 1
Checkpoint Level 1 is just a multiple-choice question on time complexity, not a coding problem, but this repo includes a screenshot of it with my answer:

### Checkpoint 2

### Checkpoint 3
For some reason my profile is showing Level-Ups for Levels 1, 2, 4, and 5, but not 3, even though among other things I did the Checkpoint Level 3 prework problems below. Here also is [a screenshot of the Checkpoint Level 3 screen.](https://github.com/tachyonlabs/codepath-alumni-interview-prep-course-prework/blob/master/interviewbit_checkpoint_3.jpg)
